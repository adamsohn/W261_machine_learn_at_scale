We explored how different data structures and design patterns can help us manage the computational complexity of an algorithm. As part of this process you implemented both a supervised learning alogorithm (Naive Bayes) and an unsupervised learning algorithm (synonym detection via cosine similarity). In both of these tasks parallelization helped us manage calculations involving a large number of features. However a large feature space isn't the only situation that might prompt us to want to parallelize a machine learning algorithm. In the final two assignments we'll look at cases where the iterative nature of an algorithm is the main driver of its computational complexity (and the reason we might want to parallelize it).\n\nIn this week's assignment we'll perform 3 kinds of linear regression: OLS, Ridge and Lasso. As in previous assignments you will implement the core calculations using Spark RDDs... though we've provided more of a code base than before since the focus of the latter half of the course is more on general machine learning concepts. By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n* ... __define__ the loss functions for OLS, Ridge and Lasso regression.\n* ... __calculate__ the gradient for each of these loss functions.\n* ... __identify__ which parts of the gradient descent algorithm can be parallelized.\n* ... __implement__ parallelized gradient descent with cross-validation and regularization.\n* ... __compare/contrast__ how L1 and L2 regularization impact model parameters & performance.\n\nAdditional Reference: [Spark 2.2 Documentation - RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/rdd-programming-guide.html)\n\n__Please refer to the `README` for homework submission instructions and additional resources.__"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Notebook Set-Up\nBefore starting your homework run the following cells to confirm your setup."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# imports\nimport re\nimport time\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport ast\nimport os"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Run the next cell to create your directory in dbfs\nYou do not need to understand this scala snippet.

As the quantity of variables increases past 3, visualization techniques will cease to clearly convey the clear optimal path to the human eye.

Also, situations where there is non-convexity or non-linear regression would cause this method to be untenable. <br><br>\n\n> __c)__ Learning rate is the size of the 'steps' a gradient descent loss function will take modifying model parameters in search of an optimum loss.

A relatively large negative coefficient (ie. penalizing red wine) would mean that white wine is typically higher quality. A relatively small positive or negative coefficient indicates that the feature lacks a relationship with quality.

It is never expected that a test set should perform better than the train set, as the model does not have benefit of training on the test data. Setting both the un-normalized and normalized data to seed=5 yields the same image, so normalization is not the root cause of the change.

This \"third step\" however comes with a tradeoff: it requires an extra pass through the data. Normally this would cause us to cringe except for the fact that both the loss computation and the gradient computation are very easy to parallelize - lots of the work can be done in place no shuffle needed for the aggregation. \n\n[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)), sometimes called rotation estimation, or out-of-sample testing, is a model validation technique for assessing how well the model will generalize to an independent data set. The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data. \n\nCross validation, which will solve the problem of the unreliable test-loss that we saw in question 5, presents a bit more of a scalability challenge. To avoid over-dependence on a particulary good or bad test/train split we divide the data into `k` roughly equal size parts and train `k` models. The `k-th` model is trained on all the data _except_ the `k-th` split which is used as a test set for that model. Finally we compute the loss by averaging together the test/train loss for each model. In this question we've provided a code base to perform gradient descent and cross validation in parallel. You'll fill in some of the key details based on your understanding from questions 1-5.\n\n#### From ISLR Chapter 5.1 - Cross Validation\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/blob/master/images/CV-ISLRp181.png?raw=true\">\n\n\n### Q6 Tasks:\n* __a) short response:__ A naive approach to training an OLS Regression model with cross validation might be to simply perform Gradient Descent on each of the 5 models in sequence.

[__`HINT:`__ _it will depend on factors that you should be able to name._]\n\n\n* __b) short response:__ Read through the provided helper function `kResiduals()` and note where it gets used in the subsequent function `CVLoss()`. For each record in the original dataset, how many tuples does `kResiduals()` emit? What are the keys of these newly emitted records? How will these keys help us compute cross validated loss?\n\n\n* __c) code:__ Complete the missing Spark code in `CVLoss()` so that this function returns the test/train cross validated error for a given set of data splits and their corresponding models. [__`TIP:`__ _your goal is to start from `partialLossRDD` and compute the test & train loss for each model so that the provided code can take the final average_].\n\n\n* __d) code:__ Read through the provided functions `partialGradients()` and `CVUpdate()`.

Chosing the right combination of features to optimize generalizability can be extremely computationally costly given that there are \\\\(2^{p}\\\\) potential models that can be built from \\\\(p\\\\) features. Traditional methods like forward selection would involve iteratively testing these options to asses which combinations of features achieve a statistically significant prediction.\n\nRidge Regression and Lasso Regression are two popular alternatives to OLS, which enable us to train generalizable models without the trouble of forward selection and/or manual feature selection.  Both methods take advantage of the bias-variance tradeoff by _shrinking_ the model coefficients towards 0 which reduces the variance of our model with little increase in bias. In practice this 'shrinkage' is achieved by adding a penalty (a.k.a. 'regularization') term to the means squared error loss function. In this question you will implement Gradient Descent with ridge and lasso regularization.\n\n__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ When performing regularization _do not_ include the bias in your regularization term calcultion (Recall, that throughout this assignment we've included the bias at index 0 in the vector of weights that is your model).\n\n### Q7 Tasks:\n* __a) short response:__ The regularization term for ridge regression is the square of the \\\\(L2\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of squares of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). Write the formulas for both the loss function and the gradient for Ridge Regularization and explain what extra step this will add to our gradient descent algorithm.\n\n\n* __b) short response:__ The regularization term for lasso regression is the \\\\(L1\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). Write the formulas for both the loss function and the gradient for Lasso Regularization and explain how the gradient descent update in Lasso will be different than it was in Ridge.\n\n\n* __c) code:__ Fill in the first two missing code blocks in `GDUpdate_wReg()` so that this function will perform a single parameter update using \\\\(L2\\\\) regularization if the parameter `regType` is set to `ridge`, \\\\(L1\\\\) regularization if set to `lasso` and unregularized OLS otherwise.\n\n\n* __d) code + short response:__ Use the provided code to train 50 iterations of ridge and lasso regression and plot the test/train error.
